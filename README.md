overview:
Health insurance price prediction is a machine learning task that involves estimating the cost of insurance premiums based on factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, and other health-related variables. Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most effective models for this type of prediction.

Understanding Linear Regression
Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. It finds the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in multiple dimensions) that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.
